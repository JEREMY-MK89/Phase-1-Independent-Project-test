## Description
This project is a basic web application built with Node.js and Express.js that allows users to give or air their sentiments/opinions in a customer feedback message or  review  (be it positive or negative) by  writing their message and  submitting it to the receiving organization.
With the Sentiment Analysis service, you will get to know the users (be it clients, employees or partners) better and it will be easier to engage with them (knowing how they feel).
